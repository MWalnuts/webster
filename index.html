			<h3>History and Authority</h3>

			<div class="row">

			<p>

						<li>Addressed global demands by providing 175000 entries - 56000 more entries than the Webster’s Unabridged edition as well as renaming the said edition to <em>Webster’s International Dictionary, Unabridged</em></li>
						<li><em>Webster's Collegiate Dictionary</em> published in 1898 with the intent to meet the needs of college students as well as general readers, seeing the impracticality of a large book/volume</li>
						<li>New editions for the Unabridged appeared in 1909,1934,1961, as well as the addition of the <em>Addenda Sections</em> which featured words that came into use after the 1961 edition, the latest in 2002</li>

			<h3>Scope and Purpose</h3>

			<div class="row">
					<p>
					<ul>
						<li>Webster’s Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged was conceived to provide a large vocabulary of information with regards to the accelerating pace of change in the cultural climate of society</li>
						<li>For instance, most social science terms can be found in the dictionary, all while providing fuller and better descriptions than those found in other dictionaries, but it is estimated that a good ⅓ of terms are not contained within the dictionary. This establishes that while not all information is provided by Webster’s 3rd, the information it does provide is arguably better than others.</li>
						</ul>

			<h3>Special Features</h3>

			<div class="row">
					<p>
						<ul>
						<li>The dictionary’s descriptive approach on how language is used and not how language should be used was charged with huge amounts of criticisms, while some others praise the work as “not to provoke controversies, but settles them. (Basically removing the mentality of “correctness”)</li>
						<li>The printed format can have an accompaniment of a CD-ROM. It also has updates that expand the Addenda Sections. An online paid version is also available</li>
						</ul>

			<h3>An Evaluation of the Reference Source</h3>

			<div class="row">
					<p>
						<ul>
						<li>The book is heavy, making it quite hard to use. The book is not made for mobility; however, Merriam-Webster has given users a solution to mobility problems. The company offers their customers a CDROM version of the book, as well as an online version which is the most ideal for those who constantly need access to the dictionary’s resources.</li>
